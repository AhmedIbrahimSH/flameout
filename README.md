## General

This project is part of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge" target="blank"><b><i><u>Google Solution Challenge 2023</u></i></b> </a>

The challenge aims to help in contributing to the 17 goals set by the United Nations to be accomplished by 2030.


## Project Desctiption

- As an Egyptian , I started to look into problems that face us as in the Egyptian community and I noticed that one of the most fundemental things that we don't have is the RECYCLING of the Fire Extinguishers , everyone almost has at least one but 98% it isnot working , and that sparked up the project idea.

- I decided to build a mobile application [to make it as accessible as possible for everybody to use the app] using Flutter , where the user enters the number of fire extinguishers he wants to recycle , and he also input his location , then approves his order.

- A futuristic plan is to build a version of the app for the workers that actually recycle the fire extinguishers , to make the application more responsive and have all functions needed for the user and the worker , and to make it a possible communication method between the two.

- Screenshots of the application is provided in the folder called 'AppScreens'.


## How this projects contributes to the United Nations 17 development goals of 2030

- Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - Recycling fire extinguishers promotes responsible consumption and production by extending the life of the product and reducing waste.

- Goal 13: Climate Action - Recycling fire extinguishers reduces the need to manufacture new ones, which reduces the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions associated with production.

- Goal 14: Life Below Water - Fire extinguishers contain chemicals that can be harmful to marine life if disposed of improperly. Recycling fire extinguishers can prevent these chemicals from polluting the oceans.

- Goal 15: Life on Land - Improperly disposed of fire extinguishers can harm wildlife and their habitats. Recycling them can prevent this damage.

- Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions - Recycling fire extinguishers can be part of a comprehensive waste management system that supports strong institutions and promotes sustainable practices.
